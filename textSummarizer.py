Our\ncommitment to carbon neutrality by 2030 is both ambitious and necessary. These efforts require innovations\nat scale—like designing and implementing new technologies, mobilizing financing structures, and rapidly\ndeploying renewable energy. Everything we do is driven by science and the urgency to tackle climate change.\n\nGoals\n\nAchieve carbon neutrality for\nour entire carbon footprint by\n2030, and reach our science-based\nemissions reduction target\n\nCreate products\nwith net zero carbon\nimpact by 2030\n\nHighlights\n\nCarbon neutral for\ncorporate operations\nsince April 2020\n\n100+ suppliers\ncommitted to\n100% renewable\nelectricity\n\n15M metric tons\nof emissions\navoided due to\ncarbon reduction\ninitiatives\n\n100% renewable\nenergy sourced for\nall Apple facilities\n\nEnergy use reduced\nby 13.9M kWh\nthrough efficiency efforts\n\nRestore Fund will invest up to\n$200M in natural climate solutions\n\nIntroduction\n\nClimate Change\n\nResources\n\nSmarter Chemistry\n\nAppendix\n\nEnvironmental Progress Report 10\n\nOur approach\nClimate change is one of the greatest threats\nof our time, putting at risk people’s access to\nclean air, adequate food, safe drinking water,\nand sanitation.\nThis means the impact of the changes we make—improving\nenergy efficiency and transitioning to renewable energy across\nour supply chain—extends beyond our factories, stores, and\noffices to benefit those who live in the communities where we\noperate. The future success of our company depends on taking\nurgent and decisive action. For years, we have increased energy\nefficiency and the use of renewable energy, yet we know we have\nto do more. That’s why last year, we unveiled our most ambitious\nplan to date: to achieve carbon neutrality for the entire life cycle\nof our products by 2030. This goal places us 20 years ahead of\nthe recommendations put forward by the Intergovernmental Panel\non Climate Change (the United Nations body for assessing the\nscience related to climate change) calling for carbon neutrality\nas a planet by 2050. The science is clear: Our world cannot wait\nfor an inclusive, carbon neutral economy. Every business has a\nresponsibility to create a meaningful plan to reduce its emissions.\nOur goal and approach are informed by science. We focus on\navoiding activities that generate carbon in the first place. And,\nwherever possible, we’re switching to lower-carbon alternatives.\nIn cases where emissions can’t be avoided, we’ll then remove\nthe equivalent amount of carbon from the atmosphere. While\nwe pursue viable solutions, we also align to the same carbon\nmitigation hierarchy in our strategy. It isn’t the easiest approach,\nbut it’s the one science shows is necessary to address\nclimate change.\n\nOur philosophy for achieving carbon neutrality follows\nthese principles:\n• Taking a comprehensive approach: Our responsibility\nextends beyond our direct operations to the entire life cycle\nof our products. We calculate emissions from the production\nof raw materials, product manufacturing, shipping, the energy\nused to power our facilities and our customers’ devices, as well\nas material recycling and recovery. Our commitment to reach\nneutrality for our full product life cycle shapes the actions we\npursue. We can effect direct change through product design\nand using low-carbon inputs. Through supplier engagement,\nwe can work with our manufacturing partners to transition\nto 100 percent renewable energy. And through the power\nof policy and industry collaboration, we can unlock climate\nsolutions on a global scale.\n• Set ambitious targets: Our plan to reach neutrality by\n2030 centers around our strategy to reduce emissions by\n75 percent, relative to our 2015 footprint. This reduction\naligns with what current climate science shows is necessary\nto limit warming to 1.5° Celsius. We’ll invest in high-quality\ncarbon removal projects to address the emissions that\nremain, prioritizing the protection of ecosystems as a\npowerful, natural carbon solution. These projects will also\nalign to rigorous international standards to ensure their impact.\nAnd by avoiding emissions first, we’ll also reduce the carbon\nwe need to remove.\n• Match solutions to sources: For each activity within our\nvalue chain, we will choose decarbonization actions that tie\nto the source of those emissions. We’ll address emissions\nfrom electricity with renewable energy and emissions from\ntransportation with alternative fuels. By matching solutions\nto carbon sources, we will do our part to decarbonize\nthe economy.\n\nOur Green Bond engages\ninvestors in our work\ntoward carbon neutrality.\nIn our 2020 Green Bond\nreport, we disclose\nprogress on the projects\nfunded over the last year\nthat bring us closer to our\n2030 goal.\nRead our 2020 Green\nBond report (PDF)."
